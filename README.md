# Connect-Four
Visual implementation of Connect Four with (very limited!) computer opponents

## Purpose

I had wanted to implement a graphical version of connect four off the heels of my Game of Life code, whose code I though was pretty much transferrable.
This version of connect four allows two computers to play against each other. Their AI is only programmed so as to grant them the limited foresight of not losing next turn if they are able to prevent it. Otherwise, if they cannot prevent a winning move from the other player, they simply drop their gamepiece down randomly.
